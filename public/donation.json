      "category_description": "Clean water is essential for growing children. It satisfies their thirst, replaces their lost fluids and doesn’t add empty calories to their diets. Many recent studies show that water is superior to fruit juices, sodas, sweetened powdered drinks, and sports drinks with added electrolytes as a source of hydration for children of all ages and activity levels. Except for infants in their first year of life, you should strive to provide water to your child throughout the day, every day, year round. Good quality water is also needed for bathing children and keeping their clothing and bedding clean. Harmful waterborne contaminants can build up on children’s skin and hair, as well as on their clothing, sheets, and blankets, triggering allergies, asthma and other illnesses. Unfortunately most of the things that contaminate water are invisible to the naked eye; some don’t affect the smell or taste of water, either.",
